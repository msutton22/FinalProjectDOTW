# Drawing on the Web Final Project!
## Maddy Sutton
### Outline
I had a lot of ideas for my final project when I first heard the criteria. At first, I thought I could make three different pages that are dedicated to different instruments that the user could interract with. Then, I thought I could make a website all dedicated to my favorite band. There were all sorts of ideas floating around my head, but I realized that the root of all the ideas, was music!

For my final project, I've decided to create three webpages dedicated to three different eras: the 60s, the 70s, and the 80s. Each of these webpages will encorporate different moments of pop culture from these decades put together in a sort of collage, all with music of the decade playing in the background. I would love to incorporate some kind of music choosing mechanism into each page so the user could choose between 3 songs of the decade to hear in the background. These webpages would all incorporate videos, gifs, and images representing the eras as well as HTML Canvas graphics to play with color of the scenes. As for my navigation, I plan on having three SVG images represent different ways to listen to music in each era. For example, for the 60s, I would have a jukebox or radio. For the 70s, I would have a record player. And for the 80s, it will be a cassette player/boombox. I plan to have the images animate in some way when the user hovers over the image. 

Overall, I'm really excited for this project!
